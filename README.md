# Mask_Detection

1)Install Gradio with the following in terminal
------  pip install gradio


2)Run the model using the file "gradio_output.py" in terminal

3)mask_detection_model_training.ipynb is used to drain a model that detects face mask on faces and it saves the model as "mask_detection.h5"

4) Pre-trained model is used to detect Faces and its components are "res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel" , "facenet.prototxt" and "deploy.prototxt"
5) To run the Final Output in Jupyter Notebook , use "Final_facemask_prediction.ipynb"
